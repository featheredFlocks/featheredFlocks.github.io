            <h1><b>EMERALD DOVE</b></h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Emerald Dove, also known as the Green Dove, is a bird species that is found throughout Southeast
                Asia,
                including India. They are also found in parts of Australia.
                <br>
                <br>
                As their name suggests, Emerald Doves have a beautiful emerald-green plumage on their wings and back,
                with a
                distinctive pinkish-brown head and neck. They have a slender body and a long tail. The male and female
                have
                a similar appearance, with the male having slightly brighter colors.
                <br>
                <br>
                These doves are primarily frugivorous and feed on a variety of fruits and seeds, including berries,
                figs,
                and grains. They are often found in forested areas, where they forage on the forest floor or in trees.
                <br>
                <br>
                Emerald Doves are monogamous and form pairs during the breeding season, which occurs from December to
                May in
                India. The female builds a flimsy nest out of twigs and leaves, which is usually placed in a tree or
                shrub.
                Both the male and female incubate the eggs and take care of the chicks.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Emerald Dove is not considered threatened and is a common sight in many parts of India. They are
                also
                popular among birdwatchers and are often observed during birdwatching tours in places such as the
                Western
                Ghats, the Northeastern states, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

            <h1><b>POND HERON</b></h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Pond Heron, also known as the Indian Pond Heron, is a small heron that is found throughout much of
                South Asia, including India. They are commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and other shallow water
                bodies, as well as in agricultural fields.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pond Herons have a brownish-grey plumage with white or buff underparts, and are known for their striking
                yellow eyes and black beak. They feed primarily on small fish, frogs, and insects, which they catch by
                wading through shallow water and using their long beaks to probe the mud and water.
                <br>
                <br>
                During breeding season, which occurs from May to August in India, the Pond Heron forms small colonies
                and builds nests in trees near water. They lay 3-5 eggs, which hatch after around 20-25 days. Both
                parents take turns incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks, which fledge after around 30-35 days.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Pond Heron is a common and widespread bird in India and is not currently considered to be
                threatened. They are often observed in wetland areas and can be seen wading through shallow water or
                perching on trees or other elevated spots. They are also known to frequent agricultural fields, where
                they can be seen feeding on insects and small creatures.

            <h1><b>ROSE FINCH</b></h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Rosefinch is a small, colorful bird that is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the
                Himalayas, Siberia, and Northern China. In India, it can be found in the Himalayan regions as well as in
                some other mountainous areas such as Sinhagad.
                <br>
                <br>
                The male Rosefinch is a bright pink color, with a darker red head and a white belly. The female is more
                subdued in color, with a grey-brown back, pinkish belly, and a yellowish or greenish tinge to the
                feathers.
                Both males and females have a short, conical bill.
                <br>
                <br>
                Rosefinches feed mainly on seeds and insects, and can be found in a variety of habitats including
                forests,
                meadows, and scrublands. During the breeding season, which typically takes place from May to July, the
                male
                Rosefinch sings a series of short, melodious notes to attract a mate.
                <br>
                <br>
                Rosefinches are migratory birds, and typically move to lower elevations during the winter months. In
                India,
                they can be found in the Himalayan foothills during the winter.
                <br>
                <br>
                While the Rosefinch is not considered to be globally threatened, populations in some areas have been
                affected by habitat loss and other factors. Conservation efforts are underway in some regions to protect
                this colorful and charismatic bird species.

            <h1><b>MALABAR PIED HORNBILL</b></h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Malabar Pied Hornbill is a large bird species that is found in the Western Ghats of India, Sri
                Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. They are known for their distinctive and colorful appearance, with
                black and white plumage, a large yellow bill, and a bushy crest on their head.
                <br>
                <br>
                Malabar Pied Hornbills are primarily frugivorous and feed on a variety of fruits, figs, and berries.
                They also consume insects, small reptiles, and mammals. They have a unique feeding habit where they
                catch and toss their food into the air before swallowing it whole.
                <br>
                <br>
                These birds are known for their impressive breeding behavior. During the breeding season, which occurs
                from December to May in India, the female seals herself inside a tree cavity with a small opening, while
                the male feeds her through the opening. The female lays eggs and incubates them inside the cavity, while
                the male brings her food. Once the chicks hatch, the male continues to feed both the female and the
                chicks until they are ready to leave the nest.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Malabar Pied Hornbill is considered a near-threatened species due to habitat loss and hunting for
                its feathers and beak, which are used in traditional medicine. Conservation efforts are being made to
                protect their habitat and prevent hunting.
                <br>
                <br>
                Malabar Pied Hornbills are a popular attraction for birdwatchers and can be observed in birdwatching
                tours in the Western Ghats region of India.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Oriental White Ibis, also known as the Black-headed Ibis, is a large wading bird that is found in
                wetlands throughout much of Asia, including India. They are known for their striking plumage, which
                includes a white body, black wings, and a black head with a long, curved beak.
                <br>
                <br>
                Oriental White Ibises are typically found in shallow wetlands, including marshes, swamps, and rice
                paddies. They feed on a variety of prey, including fish, amphibians, and small invertebrates, which they
                catch by probing the mud with their beaks.
                <br>
                <br>
                During breeding season, Oriental White Ibises form colonies and build large stick nests in trees near
                water. They lay around 2-3 eggs, which hatch after around 25-28 days. The chicks are fed by both parents
                and fledge after around 30-35 days.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Oriental White Ibis is a threatened bird species in India and is listed as Near Threatened on the
                IUCN Red List. They are often observed in wetland areas and can be seen wading through shallow water or
                perching on trees near water bodies. They are also known to frequent areas where rice is grown, where
                they can be seen feeding on insects and other prey. In Bhigwan, a small town in Maharashtra, Oriental
                White Ibises are often observed during the winter months when migratory birds visit the area.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Indian Pipit is a small, slender bird that is found throughout India, as well as in other parts of
                Asia and Africa. They are usually found in open grasslands, fields, and scrublands, and are known for
                their distinctive, high-pitched call, which sounds like "tswee-tsee-tsee".
                <br>
                <br>
                Indian Pipits have a brownish-grey plumage with streaked underparts, and a long tail that is often held
                upright. They feed primarily on insects, which they forage for on the ground, and can often be seen
                running through the grass or perching on fence posts or bushes.
                <br>
                <br>
                During breeding season, which occurs from February to August in India, the male Indian Pipit performs a
                display flight, during which he sings and flies up into the air before descending back to the ground.
                The female then selects a nest site on the ground, often in a hollow or depression in the soil, and lays
                3-6 eggs. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks, which fledge after
                around 10-12 days.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Indian Pipit is a common and widespread bird in India, and is not currently considered to be
                threatened. They are often observed in open grasslands and fields, and can be seen running through the
                grass or perching on fence posts or other elevated spots. They are also known to frequent agricultural
                fields, where they can be seen feeding on insects.
